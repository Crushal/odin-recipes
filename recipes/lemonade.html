        <p>This classic lemonade recipe is the one my mom used to make for me when I was little. Ah, the taste of summer!</p>
        <p>It's the perfect combination of sweet and tart. When using a clear pitcher, adding a few of the juiced lemon halves makes it look prettier.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 lemons</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>6 cups water, or more as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Juice lemons; you should have 1 cup juice.</li>
            <li>Combine juice, sugar, and water in a 1/2-gallon pitcher. Stir until sugar dissolves. Taste and add more water if desired.</li>
            <li>Chill and serve over ice.</li>
        </ol>
