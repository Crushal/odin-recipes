        <p>This ice cream sandwich cake was renamed as "The Best Dessert I've Ever Eaten" by my daughter this Memorial Day.</p>
        <p>I had made it before, but my husband ate all of it before she had a chance to get a taste!</p>
        <p> My husband doesn't like when I take this desert to a large gathering because it means he won't have any leftovers!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>24 vanilla ice cream sandwiches, unwrapped</li>
            <li>2 (8 ounce) containers whipped topping (such as Cool Whip®), thawed</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) jar hot fudge ice cream topping, warmed</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) jar caramel ice cream topping</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped pecans, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
